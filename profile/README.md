# Contextual Product Adoption

## For IOS, Android, Web

### No-code and Low-code user Onboarding, Feature Announcement, Engagement and Feedback

An SDK and platform that saves developer time by allowing them to:
- use prebuilt no-code templates
- wrap their own code elements into **GuideBlocks** that allows the Product Team to launch without doing new App releases

GuideBlocks help your App iterate fast and free up developers to work on features instead of engagement:

- Built-in no-code walthroughs, tips, announcements, FAQs, feedback surveys and more.
- Extensible low-code GuideBlocks
- Product Adoption audience targeting and analytics
- Improve User Activation and Retention without resorting to Anti–patterns like Pop-ups and Push Notifications
- Interact with your app components
- Allow you to Code Once, Run Anywhere, Anytime and for Any Users
